      <span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:15px;">When solving algorithmic problems, it's often useful to recognize common patterns that can be applied to a wide range of problems. Here are some common patterns to be aware of:</span>

      <span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:15px;"><strong>1) Brute Force: </strong>The Brute Force pattern involves solving a problem by trying all possible solutions and selecting the one that satisfies the problem constraints. This pattern is often used as a starting point for solving a problem, but it can be very slow for large input sizes.<br><br><strong>2) Greedy: </strong>The Greedy pattern involves making locally optimal choices at each step of the solution, with the hope that the final solution will be globally optimal. This pattern is often used to solve optimization problems that can be decomposed into subproblems.<br><br><strong>3) Divide and Conquer: </strong>The Divide and Conquer pattern involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, and then combining the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. This pattern is often used to solve problems that can be decomposed into smaller, independent subproblems.<br><br><strong>4) Dynamic Programming: </strong>Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic technique that involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computation. This pattern is often used to solve optimization problems and can be more efficient than brute force or greedy solutions.<br><strong><br>5) Backtracking: </strong>The Backtracking pattern involves exploring all possible solutions recursively and backtracking when a solution is found to be invalid. This pattern is often used to solve problems that involve finding all possible solutions or combinations.<br><strong><br>6) Depth-First Search:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that involves exploring a graph by visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This pattern is often used to solve problems that involve exploring all possible paths in a graph.<br><br>By being aware of these common patterns, you can approach algorithmic problems with a systematic and effective approach that leads to better outcomes and more efficient solutions.</span>
